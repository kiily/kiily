My name is Miguel. I am a software developer with a passion for building products. I live in London and currently work @ FLOWN as the lead developer. 

I tend to dabble on many things and have a few passing interests; currently, I am doing some writing, researching cryptocurrencies and trying to learn how to do some basic 3D printing. You can follow my writing in a few different languages, do check out my substack ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¹ ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ (not sure what flag for English ğŸ˜†)
